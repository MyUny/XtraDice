# XtraDice (Work In Progress)

XtraDice is (will be) a versatile, open-source application that enables 
users to roll dice and randomly select items from CSV and JSON 
lists. Users can specify the type and number of dice they want 
to roll and receive random results, or they can upload CSV and 
JSON lists to randomly select items. Additionally, XtraDice 
includes a statistics generator specifically for Delta Green 
and Call of Cthulhu.
